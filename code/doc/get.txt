How to get OCamlnet

{2 From OPAM}

OCamlnet is included in the main OPAM repository. Just do:

{[opam install ocamlnet]}

Some parts of OCamlnet are only installed when optional dependencies
are installed:

 - [netzip]: is only installed when the [camlzip] OPAM package is
   available (i.e. do [opam install camlzip] to get it)
 - [nettls-gnutls] (i.e. TLS supprt): is only installed when
   the [conf-gnutls] OPAM package is installed
 - [netgss-system] (i.e. GSSAPI support): is only installed when
   the [conf-gssapi] package is installed
 - [equeue-gtk2] (i.e. Gtk event loop support): is only installed
   when the [lablgtk] package is installed
 - [netstring-pcre] (i.e. using PCRE as regexp engine): is only
   installed when the [pcre] package is installed

For instance, if you want OCamlnet with TLS support, just do:

{[opam install ocamlnet conf-gnutls]}
