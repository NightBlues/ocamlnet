{1 What's new in OCamlnet 4}

{2 Security}

The main focus of this major version is the addition of strong
authentication and security. In particular, {b TLS} is now available
for all protocols. In order to achieve this, and to provide better
service functions, we switched from OpenSSL to GnuTLS. However, as it
is uncertain which TLS library will be the best in the future, the
core TLS interface has been factored out, and is now defined as module
type. So, if e.g. LibreSSL will make it in the future, it is relatively
easy to switch. The TLS provider is now a first-class module, and
plugging in an alternate provider just means to pass a different
provider module to the protocol interpreter. Read more about TLS:
{!Tls}.

There are also a lot of utility functions for TLS. In particular,
there is a parser for X.509 certificates, and there are helpers for
dealing with distinguished names. {!Netx509}, {!Netdn}.

From GnuTLS (and in particular from its crypto toolkit Nettle) we also
get access to basic cryptographic functions, including {b hash functions}
and {b symmetric ciphers}. The latter are sometimes even accelerated on
modern hardware (in particular AES). {!Netsys_digests}, 
{!Netsys_ciphers}.

While TLS is good for establishing private channels, TLS client
authentication is not that popular. Many protocols prefer {b SASL}, which
is now also defined as pluggable module: {!Netsys_sasl_types},
{!Netsys_sasl}. There are a number of mechanisms: PLAIN, CRAM-MD5,
DIGEST-MD5, SCRAM-SHA1, GSSAPI, GS2-KRB5,

Many organizations use {b Kerberos} as network login method. Access to
Kerberos authentication is possible via the {b GSSAPI}, a system
interface for authentication and security modules. The GSSAPI is
available directly or via SASL. Support for GSSAPI has been added to
all protocols for which it is defined (HTTP clients, FTP clients, RPC
clients and servers, and other protocols via SASL). Read more:
{!Gssapi}.

{2 Completed IPv6 support}

IPv6 functionality is now automatically enabled for a number of popular
OS when it is obvious that IPv6 is configured (i.e. that there is an
network interface with a global IPv6 address). Read more: {!Ipv6}

For most protocols IPv6 was already available in OCamlnet-3. There was
one exception, though: The RPC Portmapper protocol isn't capable of
IPv6. There is the newer RPCBIND protocol, though, and we support it
now.

{2 Reorganization}

There are a couple of renamings. The most important ones:

 - [Http_client]: now {!Nethttp_client}
 - [Ftp_client]: now {!Netftp_client}
 - [Xdr]: now {!Netxdr}

This means almost all OCamlnet modules use now the prefixes [Net],
[Uq_], [Rpc_] or [Shell_] (the only exceptions are [Unixqueue] and [Equeue]).

The Unicode tables have been factored out of [netstring] and are now
provided as [netunidata] library. Note that this means that the table
are inaccessible unless [netunidata] is linked in. Get more information
here: {!Netunidata}.

A few other notable updates:

 - The [pop] and [smtp] libraries have been added to [netclient]
 - [equeue-ssl] does not exist anymore. See {!Tls} about how to get
   TLS support nevertheless.
 - [netcgi1] has been deleted. Use [netcgi2] instead.
 - [rpc-auth-dh] has been deleted. Use the GSSAPI-based authentication
   for RPC instead.

{2 Bytes (in 4.1)}

Since OCamlnet-4.1, the new [Bytes] module is fully supported. All
interfaces have been checked whether the typing needed to be changed from
[string] to [bytes]. Also, OCamlnet-4.1 is now built with the
[-safe-string] option if the OCaml version is new enough.

The are two new concepts making life easier in the presence of two
string types (actually three types if you also count bigarrays of
characters):

 - A {b tagged string} or [tstring] wraps any of the three types into
   a single variant type:
   {[ type tstring = [`String of string | `Bytes of bytes | `Memory of memory] ]}
   (note that [memory] is a bigarray of characters). There is a new support
   module, {!Netstring_tstring}. We use tagged strings only when the
   string is an input to a function and not mutated.

 - A {b tagged buffer} or [tbuffer] wraps a [bytes] or [memory] buffer
   into a variant type:
   {[ type tbuffer = [`Bytes of bytes | `Memory of memory] ]}
   As we had a similar type already in previous OCamlnet versions, [tbuffer]
   got also a third variant for backward compatibility:
   {[ type tbuffer = [`Bytes of bytes | `Memory of memory | `String of bytes] ]}
   This third variant looks a little bit strange, but is certainly useful
   for helping users to transition to [bytes] buffers. This variant will be
   removed in a later version of OCamlnet again.

{2 More authentication (in 4.1)}

The IETF recently did some work on authentication, and some results
could already be incorporated into OCamlnet. The update of the HTTP
Digest authentication method to the SHA-256 hash function (instead of
MD5) went in and is automatically available for HTTP clients. Note
that there is no update on the same-named SASL mechanism, which is now
considered as "historic" in favor of the SCRAM family of mechanisms.

Regarding SCRAM for HTTP, there is an RFC draft, and the RFC is
expected soon.  I've added an experimental (but somewhat incomplete)
implementation according to the draft ({!Netmech_scram_http}).

In order to support public key mechanisms in later OCamlnet versions,
there is now pluggable public key cryptography. For users the module
{!Netx509_pubkey_crypto} makes this feature available. However, at
present there is no mechanism using this already.

Another new feature is the {!Netldap} client, wrapping the most common
LDAP client operations. This is most useful for servers wanting to
authenticate against an LDAP server. Of course, it is also useful for
other purposes, as LDAP can be used for storing any kind of information.


{2 Not yet}

A few things would have been good to have in OCamlnet-4, but they were
not available in time:

 - HTTP authentication on the server side
 - Advanced HTTP authentication frameworks such as OAUTH
 - Support for reading passwords from files
 - Non-blocking name lookups
