{1 Credentials}

{2:sasl Credentials for SASL}

For SASL credentials are specified as a list

{[ (string * string * (string * string) list) list ]}

which looks complicated and needs some explanations. Basically, this
list presents the authentication mechanism a number of encodings for
the same secret. The mechanism can then pick the encoding it can process
best. Every encoding of the secret is a tuple

{[ (type, data, params) ]}

where [type] and [data] are strings, and [params] is a
[(string * string) list) list] with [(name,value)] pairs.

Why supporting several encodings? First, there may be {b huge} differences in
the speed of the authentication mechanism, in particular when you compare
a cleartext password [pw] with the version of [pw] that is really used in
the mechanism, which is often a function of the password [kdf(pw)] (kdf =
key derivation function). These functions are designed to be slow.
Second, there may be a security benefit when a password database needs not
to store [pw], but can store [kdf(pw)], in particular on the server side.

All mechanisms support:

 - [type = "password"]: The [data] string is the raw, unprocessed password.
   Note that many mechanisms require that the password is a UTF-8 string,
   and some even request a certain UTF-8 form (the so-called string preparation
   of the password). The password type does not take any parameters.

The other types are mechanism-specific, and are usually only supported on
the server side:

 - [type = "authpassword-SCRAM-SHA-1"]: The [data] string is the "stored
   password" for the mechanism SCRAM-SHA-1. There is one parameter "info"
   containing the iteration count and the salt. These two strings are defined
   in RFC-5803. OCamlnet uses here intentionally the same format as is
   commonly used in LDAP servers for storing SCRAM credentials. See
   {!Netmech_scram_sasl.SCRAM} for sample code how to generate this encoding.

(This list will probably be extended.)

OCamlnet tries to support types conforming either to the pattern defined
in RFC 3112 or RFC 2307. See
{!Netsys_sasl_types.SASL_MECHANISM.init_credentials} for details.

{3 UTF-8}

All user names and passwords for SASL mechanisms must be given in UTF-8.

{3 SASLprep}

Moreover, there is a special algorithm normalizing characters where
Unicode permits several ways of encoding them: SASLprep. In OCamlnet,
SASLprep is implemented by {!Netsaslprep}.

Newer SASL mechanisms require that user names and passwords go through
SASLprep. Although older mechansims do not strictly require this yet,
it is often also a good idea to apply SASLprep nevertheless, as all
mechanisms access the same password database.

OCamlnet does not automatically call SASLprep. Callers of the SASL
mechanisms should do that before the user names and passwords reach
the mechanism implementations, e.g.

{[
  let creds =
    [ "password", Netsaslprep.saslprep pw, [] ]
]}

The reason is that SASLprep is fairly expensive, and should best only
called once when several mechanisms have been enabled.

{2:tls Credentials for TLS}

The (X.509) credentials exist here in two "flavors", namely certificates and
private keys.

 - A certificate is a public key that is signed by a trust center. In order
   to be exact, we should also take the revocations into account, present
   in form of CRLs (certificate revocation lists).
 - A private key is a large random number.

What makes the handling of these data structures a bit problematic are the
various encodings and container formats. Usually certificates and keys are
stored on disk, where key files are often password-protected. But one step
after the other:

{b Representations in RAM}

 - DER encoding of certificates: This is the primary way certificates are
   represented as binary BLOB. The DER encoding is not directly used for
   storing certificates in files. In OCamlnet, the DER encoding is a
   string (or string list) tagged with [`DER]. 
 - Certificates as parsed objects: The DER encoding can be parsed, and
   their contents are made accessible as {!Netx509.x509_certificate} objects.
   The parser function is {!class:Netx509.x509_certificate_from_DER}.
 - DER encoding of CRLs: Like for certificates there is a DER encoding for
   revocation lists. The tag [`DER] is also used for these lists. There is,
   however, no parser callable from OCaml. (Inside GnuTLS there is a parser.)
 - Private keys can exist in various encodings: RSA, DSA, EC, and PKCS-8.
   These are also binary encodings based on ASN.1, but with a different
   internal format. The formats for RSA, DSA, and EC are for the respective
   public key mechanisms. PKCS-8 is a container format that can contain
   any of these formats internally, and that optionally also supports
   encryption. In OCamlnet, the tags [`RSA], [`DSA], [`EC], [`PKCS8] and
   [`PKCS8_encrypted] are attached to strings with the respective formats.
   As of now, no parsers for any of these formats are callable from
   OCaml. {b Important note:} Encrypted keys are only supported via PKCS-8.
   If you have a PEM file with a "DEK-Info" header, this file cannot be
   read in. Convert it to PKCS-8 first with an external tool.

{b Representations on disk}

As mentioned, there is always a container format:

{ul
 {- PEM files: These text files are made up of sections, and every section
    consists of a header like "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----", the base64
    encoded data, and a trailer like "-----END CERTIFICATE-----". Various
    types of objects are supported. There is a generic parser for the PEM
    format in {!Netascii_armor}. These are the objects (per header string):
    {ul
      {- "X509 CERTIFICATE" or "CERTIFICATE": The data is the DER encoding
         of the certificate}
      {- "X509 CRL": The data is the DER encoding of the CRL}
      {- "RSA PRIVATE KEY": The data is the RSA key}
      {- "DSA PRIVATE KEY": The data is the DSA key}
      {- "EC PRIVATE KEY": The data is the EC key}
      {- "PRIVATE KEY": The data is in PKCS-8 format}
      {- "ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY": The data is in the encrypted PKCS-8 format}
    }
 }
 {- PKCS-12 files: so far unsupported in OCamlnet}
}

Note that OCamlnet does not contain any utility for generating these
files. You can use the GnuTLS utility [certtool] or the [openssl] command.

Besides X.509 credentials, there are also other types (e.g. SRP or
OpenPGP credentials) that be used with TLS. This is quite uncommon,
though, and should only be used in special situations. At present,
such alternate authentication methods are not supported in these TLS
bindings.


{2:gssapi Credentials for the GSSAPI}

{3 The system-level GSSAPI}

You can usually pass credentials as pairs [ string * oid ] where the
string contain the data formatted according to the rules for the OID.

At present, there are no helper functions to support any type of OID
better that is possible here.
